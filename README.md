# Node.js and Express HTTP Server

This project demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server using Node.js and Express.js.  
It provides API endpoints to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Express routing, query parameters, and JSON responses.

---

## Features

- Built using Express.js
- Supports four arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Handles query parameters in GET requests
- Returns JSON responses
- Minimal and easy to understand structure

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| Node.js | JavaScript runtime environment |
| Express.js | Framework for building web servers |
| JavaScript (ES6) | Language used for implementation |

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonisavita/http-server.git

2.	Navigate to the project directory:
   
    cd header-query-param-eg

4.	Install dependencies:
   
    npm install

5.	Start the server:
   
    node index.js

6.	Open your browser or API client (Postman, curl) to:

   http://localhost:3000
   

Learning Context

This project was built while following a guided course tutorial to strengthen understanding of:
	•	Setting up a Node.js + Express server
	•	Handling routes and query parameters
	•	Working with HTTP requests and responses
	•	Managing project structure and dependencies
